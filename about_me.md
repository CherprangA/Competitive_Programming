Hi, I'm **Anil Kumar** a.k.a **Cherprang** becuase I love Cherprang Areekul from BNK48. (Let's not get in to that :grimacing:)<br>
I don't use Facebook, so, ping me on Instagram at [cherprang_a](https://www.instagram.com/cherprang_a/)<br>
I'm a weeb, kinda degen, um ok degen actually. Anyway check my [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/profile/Cherprang)<br>
I play a ton of Overwatch although I'm hard stuck gold with silver portrait :neutral_face:. Send friend request, may be you can carry me out of gold. My favourite players are [Jake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_(gamer)), [Poko]() and, [Carpe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpe). You gussed it, I love [Philadelphia Fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Fusion). If Jake is a pro now, I would've switched to [Houston Outlaws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Outlaws).
